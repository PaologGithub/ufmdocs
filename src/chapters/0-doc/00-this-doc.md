# What's this documentation?
This documentation helps you out with setting up [UrsinaForMobile](https://github.com/PaologGithub/UrsinaForMobile/).
The doc itself won't be anymore with the main repository. It is hosted in [this repo](https://github.com/PaologGithub/ufmdocs).

So, if you want to change UfM itself, do pull requests on the main repo. If you want to change the documentation, change the docs repo.

## About the docs
