# Other methods of installation
This step **isn't required**. This is if, for example, BundleTool doesn't work, or that you used the AAB -> Universal APK.

## When AAB -> Universal APK used
This method gave you a `.apk` file, that you can just open in Android, or use `adb install Path/To/Apk.apk` to install from the computer.

## Other ways for APKs
You can use, in Android, for example, `File Manager +` (On F-Droid and Google Play Store), which provide support for `.apks` (simply clicking on it will install the app).
It doesn't seem that the Native File Explorer support `.apks`, so it is a `File Manager +` functionnality.
