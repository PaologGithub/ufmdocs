# Your Game
The chapters before made you create an UfM repository, build and install the produced application.

This chapter is about making your own game; with this chapter, you'll learn how to include assets, modify the code, logging, and some other things.

Everything in this chapter is required; in this chapter, you can see which sub-chapter is interesting / you need, and just go to them.
It is good, for your understanding of this project, to read every part; but it isn't required.

### Coming Soon (I'm writing this while going to school, and now I really need to focus on the road and not on my phone.)
